Puppet Scripts
==============

My puppet manifests and modules. I use [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Packer](http://www.packer.io/) for 
my development on local machine and for prod machine on AWS. Post that puppet script ( here base.pp ) is invoked which 
installs all the dependencies. I wrote these modules since I wanted to learn more about puppet.

However if all you are concerned is getting system up and running then it may make more sense to have a look at the following:
* [Example 42 Puppet modules](https://github.com/example42/puppet-modules)
* [Puppet labs forge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/)

In order to learn how to write your own puppet modules [check this](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/modules1.html).

In case if this repo helps you do send me a PM. Feels good to know it helped someone. Cheers.
