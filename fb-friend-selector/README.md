README
=========================================
This friend selector is based on the work of These Days friend selector. You can grab the original code from here https://github.com/thesedays/Facebook-friend-selector
For diving into the nitty gritty of the code kindly check the original README at facbook-friend-selector git repo.

The interface component can be used to post FB wall post to multiple friends. I have added the functionality to select friends by clicking on them and to delete them by either double click or clicking the cross icon.

For the impatient ones : you just have to replace app id in example.js with your facebook app id to get up and running.
